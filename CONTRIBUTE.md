## Contributing to Compute
This is our core service, for private compute and storage of data. Code here is written in Rust, and is executed within an Intel SGX enclave. 
For more detail, see `/enclave`. @lacabra is leading development of this component. 

## Contributing to client application
Currently, we are discussing the application-side and UX within `docs/ux`. We are building a simple web app interface to demonstrate the Compute service.
We welcome any help on this, including: full-stack web app development, UX consultation, UX design
Furthermore, we want to enable external apps to communicate with our compute service via our API. We welcome apps who want to use our backend to discuss their API requirements with us.

## Contributing to research
We are doing research on:
- what contact tracing tools exist
- what data is most valuable for effective contact tracing
